The test should reveal the ability to calculate the projection of some points onto a plane (in 3D).

- the plane is defined by the points read from PlanePoints.csv
- the points to be projected are read from Points.csv
- the program should save the projected points in Projections.csv
- the program should order the points with respect to the distance from plane and save them in OrderedProjections.csv, along with the distance from the plane.

There are two entries up for style and efficiency discussion.
